For myself.

SDKHooks exposes the following forwards:
/**
 * @brief When an entity is created
 *
 * @param        entity        Entity index
 * @param        classname    Class name
 * @noreturn
 */
forward OnEntityCreated(entity, const String:classname[]);

/**
 * @brief When an entity is destroyed
 *
 * @param        entity        Entity index
 * @noreturn
 */
forward OnEntityDestroyed(entity);

/**
 * @brief When the game description is retrieved
 *
 * @param        gameDesc        Game description
 * @noreturn
 */
forward Action:OnGetGameDescription(String:gameDesc[64]);

/**
 * @brief When the level is initialized
 *
 * @param        mapName            Name of the map
 * @param        mapEntities    Entities of the map
 * @noreturn
 */
forward Action:OnLevelInit(const String:mapName[], String:mapEntities[2097152]); 

These forwards are optionally delegated functions. 
In effect, you can write a function with the same name into your plugin to call it when the forward occurs.

SDKHook() allows a custom function to be called whenever the Hooked event occurs.
The function SDKHook() takes three parameters: SDKHook(entityID, SDKHookType, callback_Function).
SDKHookType's are declared in an enum in sourcemod/scripting/include/sdkhooks.inc.

So, if you wanted to hook every created entities OnTakeDamage, you could do:

public OnEntityCreated(int entity, const char[] classname)
{    
	SDKHook(entity, SDKHook_OnTakeDamage, OnTakeDamage);    
}

And then you could write your custom function that does something whenever an entity takes damage.

public Action OnTakeDamage(victim, &attacker, &inflictor, &Float:damage, &damagetype){
    PrintToServer("something!");
    return Plugin_Continue;
}



HookEvent() allows you to do similar things, assigning a callback function to many Source events.
EX: To hook a custom function into the player_connect event:

public void OnPluginStart(){HookEvent("player_connect", Event_PlayerConnect);}

public void Event_PlayerConnect(Event event, const char[] name, bool dontBroadcast)
{
    int client = GetClientOfUserId(event.GetInt("userid"));
    if (client > 0)
    {
        OnClientPutInServer(client);
    }
}


Only Action's need to return these:
Plugin_Continue - The original command will be processed, if there was one.
Plugin_Handled - The original command will not be processed, if there was one.
Plugin_Stop - The original server command will not be processed, if there was one. Additionally, no further hooks will be called for this command until it is fired again.
