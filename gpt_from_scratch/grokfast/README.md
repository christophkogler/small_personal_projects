# small_personal_projects\gpt_from_scratch\grokfast
## Description

This directory contains a Python script, `grokfast.py`, which provides two functions for gradient filtering: `gradfilter_ma` and `gradfilter_ema`. These functions are designed to modify gradients of PyTorch models during training, implementing moving average and exponential moving average filtering techniques, respectively. The directory also includes compiled Python bytecode files generated by the Python interpreter.

# small_personal_projects\gpt_from_scratch\grokfast\__pycache__
## Description

This directory contains compiled Python bytecode files generated by the Python interpreter for modules used in the `grokfast` project. The files are encoded in a binary format and are not human-readable. They are likely used to store compiled versions of Python modules for faster execution.

# grokfast.py
## Description
This script contains two functions for gradient filtering: `gradfilter_ma` and `gradfilter_ema`. These functions are designed to modify gradients of PyTorch models during training.

### gradfilter_ma
- This function implements a moving average filter on gradients.
- It takes a PyTorch model `m`, an optional dictionary of gradients `grads`, a window size `window_size`, a learning rate `lamb`, a filter type (`mean` or `sum`), and a boolean flag `warmup` as parameters.
- It filters the gradients of the model's parameters and adds the filtered value to the gradients.

### gradfilter_ema
- This function implements an exponential moving average filter on gradients.
- It takes a PyTorch model `m`, an optional dictionary of gradients `grads`, an exponential decay factor `alpha`, and a learning rate `lamb` as parameters.
- It filters the gradients of the model's parameters and adds the filtered value to the gradients.

These functions are designed to be used during training to modify the gradients of a PyTorch model. They can be used to implement various gradient filtering techniques, such as gradient clipping, gradient normalization, or gradient masking.
