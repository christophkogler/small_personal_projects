## Description:
## This directory contains a Python module for gradient filtering in PyTorch models.

## The module provides two functions:
##   - gradfilter_ma: applies a moving average filter to gradients
##   - gradfilter_ema: applies an exponential moving average filter to gradients

## These functions can be used to implement various gradient filtering techniques during model training.

# grokfast.py
## Description:
## This module provides two functions for gradient filtering: gradfilter_ma and gradfilter_ema.
## They are designed to modify gradients of a PyTorch model's parameters during training.
## The functions can be used to implement various gradient filtering techniques, such as moving average and exponential moving average.

## gradfilter_ma:
##   - Applies a moving average filter to the gradients of a model's parameters.
##   - The filter is applied after a specified number of iterations (window_size) and with a specified learning rate (lamb).
##   - The filter type can be either 'mean' or 'sum'.

## gradfilter_ema:
##   - Applies an exponential moving average filter to the gradients of a model's parameters.
##   - The filter is applied with a specified decay rate (alpha) and learning rate (lamb).

## Usage:
##   - Import the module and call the desired function, passing in the model and any optional arguments.
##   - The functions return a dictionary of filtered gradients.

## Note:
##   - The functions modify the gradients in-place, so no additional memory is allocated.
##   - The functions can be used in conjunction with other gradient filtering techniques or optimization algorithms.
