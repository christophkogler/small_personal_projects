## Description
This directory contains a Python script, grokfast.py, which provides two functions for gradient filtering: `gradfilter_ma` and `gradfilter_ema`. These functions are designed to modify gradients of PyTorch models during training, allowing for various gradient filtering techniques such as gradient clipping, normalization, and masking.

# grokfast.py
## Description
This script contains two functions for gradient filtering: `gradfilter_ma` and `gradfilter_ema`. These functions are designed to modify gradients of PyTorch models during training.

### gradfilter_ma
This function implements a moving average filter on gradients. It takes a PyTorch module `m`, an optional dictionary of gradients `grads`, a window size `window_size`, a learning rate `lamb`, a filter type (`mean` or `sum`), and a boolean `warmup` as arguments. It returns a dictionary of gradients.

### gradfilter_ema
This function implements an exponential moving average filter on gradients. It takes a PyTorch module `m`, an optional dictionary of gradients `grads`, an alpha value `alpha`, and a learning rate `lamb` as arguments. It returns a dictionary of gradients.

Both functions are designed to be used during training to modify the gradients of a PyTorch model. They can be used to implement various gradient filtering techniques, such as gradient clipping, gradient normalization, or gradient masking.
