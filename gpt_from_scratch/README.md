# small_personal_projects\gpt_from_scratch
## Description

This directory contains a collection of scripts and files related to training and experimenting with GPT models. It includes scripts for training GPT models on the Shakespeare dataset, implementing gradient filtering techniques, and managing a Conda environment for deep learning and scientific computing tasks. The directory also contains a sample text file with excerpts from Shakespeare's plays.

# small_personal_projects\gpt_from_scratch\grokfast
## Description

This directory contains a Python script, `grokfast.py`, which provides two functions for gradient filtering: `gradfilter_ma` and `gradfilter_ema`. These functions are designed to modify gradients of PyTorch models during training, implementing moving average and exponential moving average filtering techniques, respectively. The directory also includes compiled Python bytecode files generated by the Python interpreter.

# clean-make-shakespeare.py
## Description
This script trains a small GPT model on the tiny-shakespeare dataset. The model is composed of layered attention blocks, each containing a multi-head attention layer and a feedforward layer. The model is trained using the AdamW optimizer and exponential learning rate decay. The script also implements a tensorboard tracker and a simple character-level tokenization method.

# environment.yml
## Description
This is a Conda environment file that defines a Python environment for deep learning and scientific computing. It includes packages for PyTorch, CUDA, cuDNN, and various dependencies for data science and machine learning tasks.

## Key Features
- PyTorch 2.3.1 with CUDA 12.1 and cuDNN 8.0 support
- CUDA toolkit 11.8.0
- cuDNN 8.0.4
- Various scientific computing libraries (e.g., NumPy, SciPy, Pandas)
- Data science libraries (e.g., Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib)
- Machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow)

## Usage
To create this environment, run `conda env create -f environment.yml` in your terminal. This will install all the specified packages and their dependencies.

# make-shakespeare.py
## Description
This script trains a transformer-based language model on the Shakespeare dataset. It implements a transformer model with 6 layers, 6 attention heads, and a vocabulary size of 384. The model is trained using the AdamW optimizer and a learning rate of 3e-4. The script also includes functions for generating text and evaluating the model's performance.

## Usage
To run the script, simply execute `python make-shakespeare.py`. The script will train the model for 5000 iterations and generate text every 1000 iterations. The generated text can be viewed by running `easy_report(model)`.

## Model Architecture
The model architecture is based on the transformer model described in the paper "Attention Is All You Need" by Vaswani et al. It consists of 6 layers, each containing a multi-head attention mechanism and a feed-forward network. The model also includes a layer normalization layer after the final feed-forward network.

## Training
The model is trained on the Shakespeare dataset, which is a text file containing the complete works of William Shakespeare. The dataset is tokenized into a vocabulary of 384 unique characters. The model is trained using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 3e-4 and a batch size of 16. The training process is divided into 50 iterations, and the model's performance is evaluated every 50 iterations.

## Generation
The script includes a function `easy_generate(model)` that generates text using the trained model. The function takes a context string as input and generates text based on the model's predictions. The generated text can be viewed by running `easy_report(model)`.

## Evaluation
The script includes a function `estimate_loss(model)` that evaluates the model's performance on the training and validation sets. The function calculates the cross-entropy loss between the model's predictions and the true labels.

## Hyperparameters
The script includes several hyperparameters that can be adjusted to fine-tune the model's performance. These include the learning rate, batch size, number of layers, number of attention heads, and the vocabulary size.

# tiny-shakespeare.txt
## Description
This file contains a collection of excerpts from William Shakespeare's plays, specifically Act 2, Scene 1 of "Coriolanus" and Act 5, Scene 1 of "The Tempest". The text includes dialogue between various characters, including First Citizen, Second Citizen, Menenius, Caius Marcius, Ferdinand, Prospero, Miranda, Ariel, Gonzalo, Sebastian, Antonio, Alonso, and Francisco. The excerpts showcase Shakespeare's mastery of language, exploring themes of rebellion, power, and the human condition.
