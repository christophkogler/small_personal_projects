# small_personal_projects\gpt_from_scratch
## Description
This directory contains a collection of scripts and files related to training and experimenting with GPT models. It includes scripts for training GPT models on the Shakespeare dataset, as well as a Python script for gradient filtering using the GrokFast library. The directory also contains a Conda environment file for setting up a deep learning environment optimized for PyTorch.

# small_personal_projects\gpt_from_scratch\grokfast
## Description
This directory contains a Python script, grokfast.py, which provides two functions for gradient filtering: `gradfilter_ma` and `gradfilter_ema`. These functions are designed to modify gradients of PyTorch models during training, allowing for various gradient filtering techniques such as gradient clipping, normalization, and masking.

# .gitignore
## Description:
This file is a Git ignore file for the 'gpt_from_scratch' project. It specifies files and directories that should be excluded from version control.

## Contents:
The file contains two entries:
- 'runs': This directory likely contains temporary or generated files from the project's execution, which should be excluded from version control to keep the repository clean and focused on the project's source code.

- 'build-gpt': This directory probably contains build artifacts or compiled files generated during the project's build process. Excluding it from version control helps maintain a clean and reproducible build environment.

## Purpose:
By ignoring these directories, the repository remains organized and efficient, with only the project's source code and essential files tracked by Git. This helps prevent unnecessary clutter and ensures that the project's build and execution processes remain consistent across different environments.

# clean-make-shakespeare.py
## Description
This script trains a GPT model on the tiny-shakespeare dataset. The model is composed of layered attention blocks, each containing a multi-head attention layer and a feedforward layer. The model is trained using the AdamW optimizer and exponential learning rate decay. The script also implements a simple character-level tokenization method and uses the GrokFast library to amplify low-frequency gradients. The model is evaluated every 50 training iterations and generates text every 1000 iterations.

# environment.yml
## Description
This is a Conda environment file that defines a Python environment for deep learning tasks, specifically optimized for PyTorch. It includes a wide range of dependencies, including CUDA and cuDNN for GPU acceleration, as well as various libraries for scientific computing and data analysis.

## Key Features
- PyTorch 2.3.1 with CUDA 12.1 and cuDNN 8.0 support
- Optimized for NVIDIA GPUs
- Includes a variety of scientific computing libraries (e.g., NumPy, SciPy, Pandas)
- Supports data analysis and visualization with libraries like Matplotlib and Scikit-learn
- Includes tools for machine learning and deep learning development

## Usage
To create this environment, run `conda env create -f environment.yml` in your terminal. This will install all the specified packages and dependencies.

# make-shakespeare.py
## Description
This script trains a transformer-based language model on the Shakespeare dataset. It defines a custom transformer architecture and implements training and evaluation functions. The model is trained using the AdamW optimizer and the cross-entropy loss function. The script also includes functions for generating text and reporting the model's performance.

## Key Features
- Custom transformer architecture with multi-head attention and feed-forward networks
- Training and evaluation functions
- Text generation capabilities
- Model reporting and performance metrics

## Dependencies
- PyTorch
- Grokfast library for gradient filtering

## Usage
To use this script, simply run it and it will train the model on the Shakespeare dataset. The model's performance can be evaluated by calling the `easy_report` function. The script also includes functions for generating text and reporting the model's performance.

# tiny-shakespeare.txt
## Description

This text is an excerpt from William Shakespeare's play "Coriolanus" and "The Tempest". The first part is a scene from "Coriolanus" where a group of citizens are discussing their grievances against the patricians and their leader, Caius Marcius. They decide to take action against him, but are interrupted by Menenius Agrippa, who tries to persuade them to abandon their rebellion.

The second part is a scene from "The Tempest" where a group of characters, including Alonso, Sebastian, Antonio, and Gonzalo, are discussing their situation on a deserted island. They talk about their past experiences and their hopes for the future, with Gonzalo describing his ideal society where everyone lives in harmony and abundance. The scene ends with the characters falling asleep, except for Sebastian, who is left awake and pondering the strange drowsiness that has overcome the others.
