# small_personal_projects\gpt-from-scratch
## Description
The 'pt-from-scratch' directory is a project that involves the development of a language model using PyTorch, a deep learning framework. The project includes a .gitignore file for the build environment, an environment.yaml file for setting up the environment, a Python script for a language model, and a passage from Shakespeare's play "Coriolanus" for training the model. The project is designed to generate text based on a prompt or context using a transformer model trained on a dataset of Shakespeare's works. The model utilizes techniques such as self-attention, residual connections, and dropout to improve its performance and can be trained on a GPU or CPU. The project is a demonstration of the capabilities of PyTorch in building language models and generating text based on patterns and structures of language.

# .gitignore
## Description:
This file is a .gitignore file for the "build-gpt" directory, which is a part of the "pt-from-scratch" project. It is used to specify files and directories that should be excluded from version control in the Git repository. The "build-gpt" directory is likely a build environment for a GPU-accelerated Anaconda environment with PyTorch (PT) installed.

# environment.yaml
## Description: This environment was built for a Windows 10 machine with an Nvidia RTX 3060. It may not function on other hardware or operating systems.

# speak_to_me.py
## Description
This script is a Python implementation of a language model, specifically a transformer model, designed to generate text based on a given input. The model is trained on a dataset of Shakespeare's works and is capable of generating text based on a prompt or context. The model is designed to learn the patterns and structures of language and generate text based on that understanding. The model is trained using PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework, and utilizes various techniques such as self-attention, residual connections, and dropout to improve its performance. The model is designed to be trained on a GPU, but can also run on a CPU if a GPU is not available.

# tiny-shakespeare.txt
## Description

This file contains a passage from Act 1, Scene 1 of William Shakespeare's play "Coriolanus" (also known as "Coriolanus, Prince of Rome"). The scene takes place in the streets of Rome, where a group of citizens are discussing the economic crisis and the rise of the patricians. They are considering taking action against the patricians, including Caius Marcius, who is seen as an enemy of the people. The citizens are frustrated with the lack of food and resources, and are willing to take drastic measures to address the situation. Meanwhile, a character named Menenius Agrippa, a noble and honest man, tries to reason with them, explaining that the patricians are not the cause of their problems, but rather the gods. The scene ends with the citizens deciding to take action against the patricians, while Menenius warns them of the consequences.
