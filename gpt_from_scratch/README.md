# small_personal_projects\gpt_from_scratch
## Description
This directory contains a collection of scripts and modules for training and fine-tuning GPT models. It includes a Python module for gradient filtering, a Conda environment file for deep learning tasks, and scripts for training GPT models on the Shakespeare dataset. The scripts utilize the PyTorch library and the GrokFast library for efficient gradient accumulation.

# small_personal_projects\gpt_from_scratch\grokfast
## Description:
## This directory contains a Python module for gradient filtering in PyTorch models.

## The module provides two functions:
##   - gradfilter_ma: applies a moving average filter to gradients
##   - gradfilter_ema: applies an exponential moving average filter to gradients

## These functions can be used to implement various gradient filtering techniques during model training.

# .gitignore
## Description:
This file is a Git ignore file for the GPT from Scratch project. It specifies files and directories that should be excluded from version control.

## Purpose:
The purpose of this file is to prevent unnecessary files and directories from being committed to the repository, keeping the project's history clean and organized.

## Contents:
The file contains two entries:

1. `runs/`: This directory is likely used for storing temporary or intermediate results of the GPT model training process. Excluding it from version control helps keep the repository size manageable and prevents unnecessary files from being tracked.

2. `build-gpt/`: This directory is probably used for building or compiling the GPT model. Excluding it from version control ensures that the build process is not tracked, which can be useful for maintaining project dependencies and avoiding version conflicts.

## Usage:
To use this file, simply place it in the root directory of your project and Git will ignore the specified files and directories when committing changes.

# clean-make-shakespeare.py
## Description

This script trains a GPT model on the tiny-shakespeare dataset. The model is composed of layered attention blocks, each containing a multi-head attention layer and a feedforward layer. The model is trained using the AdamW optimizer and exponential learning rate decay. The script also implements a simple character-level tokenization method and uses the Grokfast library to amplify low-frequency gradients. The model is evaluated every 50 training iterations and generates text every 1000 iterations. The script uses PyTorch and TensorBoard for logging and visualization.

# environment.yml
## Description
This is a Conda environment file that defines a Python environment for deep learning tasks, specifically optimized for PyTorch. It includes a wide range of dependencies, including CUDA and cuDNN for GPU acceleration, as well as various libraries for scientific computing and data analysis.

## Key Features
- Optimized for PyTorch 2.3.1 with CUDA 12.1 and cuDNN 8.0
- Includes CUDA and cuDNN for GPU acceleration
- Supports various scientific computing and data analysis libraries
- Utilizes the Anaconda package manager for dependency management

## Usage
To create this environment, run `conda env create -f environment.yml` in your terminal. This will install all the specified dependencies and create a new environment named after the file. You can then activate the environment using `conda activate <env_name>` and start using the installed packages.

# make-shakespeare.py
## Description
This script trains a transformer-based language model on the Shakespeare dataset. It uses the PyTorch library and the GrokFast library for efficient gradient accumulation. The model is trained using a custom dataset of Shakespeare's works, which is tokenized into a vocabulary of 64 unique characters. The model consists of 6 transformer layers with 6 attention heads each, and uses a feed-forward network with 4x the embedding dimension as the feed-forward network. The model is trained using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 3e-4 and a batch size of 16. The script also includes functions for generating text and reporting the model's performance.

# tiny-shakespeare.txt
## Description
This text is an excerpt from William Shakespeare's play "Coriolanus" and "The Tempest". The first part is a scene from "Coriolanus" where a group of citizens are discussing their grievances against the patricians and their leader, Caius Marcius. They decide to take action against him, but are interrupted by Menenius Agrippa, who tries to persuade them to stop their rebellion. The second part is a scene from "The Tempest" where a group of characters are discussing their situation on a deserted island. They talk about their past and their hopes for the future, and Gonzalo describes his ideal society where everyone lives in harmony and abundance.
