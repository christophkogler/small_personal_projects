# small_personal_projects
## Description
The 'small_personal_projects' directory contains a collection of personal projects and directories that showcase various coding and development skills. It includes the Celestial Forge Roller Web UI, a web-based interface for celestial body simulations, and a simple README generator project. The Celestial Forge Roller Web UI utilizes the Gradio library to create an interactive interface for celestial body simulations, allowing users to roll powers from a CSV file, filter by domain, and weight rolls based on cost. The simple README generator project includes a documentation for the Obo model's completions API and a Python script to generate README files for directories and their subdirectories. The project also includes a test directory with an empty test folder.
