# small_personal_projects
## Description
The 'small_projects' directory contains a collection of small-scale projects and applications, each with its own unique purpose and functionality. It includes the Celestial Forge Roller Web UI, a text-based game and web interface for the Celestial universe, and a simple README generator. The Celestial Forge Roller Web UI allows users to roll powers from a CSV file, filter by domain, and weight rolls based on cost, with features for loading and saving previous rolls, undoing the last roll, and displaying the roll history. The simple README generator is a flexible tool for generating README files for directories and their subdirectories, and can be used with different APIs such as Obooga WebUI and OpenAI Completions.
