# small_personal_projects\simple_readme_generator
## Requirements
- `pip install requests`
- An OpenAI API-compatible text generation backend at localhost:5000 (I recommend [this one](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui) ).
- A Llama 3/3.1 model.
## Description
This directory contains a simple README generator project, which includes a Python script and documentation for a text generation API. The project allows users to generate a README file for a directory and its contents using a text generation API. It also includes a file containing the API documentation for the Oobabooga API's completions endpoint.

This directory contains a single empty folder named 'test'.

# completions_docs.txt
## Description
This file contains the API documentation for the Oobabooga API, specifically the completions endpoint. It outlines the available parameters, their types, and default values for generating completions using the Oobabooga model.

## Parameters
The API accepts a variety of parameters to customize the generation of completions. These include:

- `model`: The ID of the model to use for generation.
- `prompt`: The prompt(s) to generate completions for, which can be a string, array of strings, array of tokens, or array of token arrays.
- `best_of`: The number of candidate completions to generate, with the "best" one returned based on log probability per token.
- `echo`: Whether to echo back the prompt in addition to the completion.
- `frequency_penalty`: A value between -2.0 and 2.0 that penalizes new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text.
- `logit_bias`: A JSON object that maps tokens to bias values to modify their likelihood of appearing in the completion.
- `logprobs`: The number of log probabilities to include in the response.
- `max_tokens`: The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the completion.
- `n`: The number of completions to generate for each prompt.
- `presence_penalty`: A value between -2.0 and 2.0 that penalizes new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far.
- `seed`: An optional seed for deterministic sampling.
- `stop`: Sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.
- `stream`: Whether to stream back partial progress.
- `suffix`: The suffix that comes after a completion of inserted text.
- `temperature`: The sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2.
- `top_p`: An alternative to sampling with temperature, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass.
- `user`: A unique identifier representing the end-user.

## Additional Options
The API also accepts various additional options, including:

- `preset`: An Oobabooga preset to load.
- `dynamic_temperature`: A dynamic temperature setting.
- `repetition_penalty`: A repetition penalty value.
- `epsilon_cutoff` and `eta_cutoff`: Cutoff values for certain penalties.
- `guidance_scale`: A guidance scale value.
- `negative_prompt`: A negative prompt.
- `penalty_alpha`: A penalty alpha value.
- `mirostat_mode`, `mirostat_tau`, and `mirostat_eta`: Values for the Llama-only sampler.
- `temperature_last`: Whether to apply temperature after samplers.
- `do_sample`: Whether to perform sampling.
- `seed`: An inference seed.
- `encoder_repetition_penalty`, `no_repeat_ngram_size`, `dry_multiplier`, `dry_base`, `dry_allowed_length`, and `dry_sequence_breakers`: Values for repetition penalties and dry runs.
- `truncation_length`: The length to truncate the prompt to.
- `max_tokens_second`: The maximum streaming tokens per second.
- `prompt_lookup_num_tokens`: The number of tokens to look up in the prompt.
- `custom_token_bans`: Custom token bans.
- `auto_max_new_tokens`: Whether to automatically set the maximum new tokens.
- `ban_eos_token`: Whether to prevent the model from outputting the end of response token.
- `add_bos_token`: Whether to add the beginning of sequence token.
- `skip_special_tokens`: Whether to skip special tokens.
- `grammar_string`: A grammar string.

## Notes
The API documentation provides detailed information on each parameter, including their types, default values, and usage. It also includes notes on the effects of certain parameters and how they can be used to customize the generation of completions.

# readme_generator_v2.py
## Description
A Python script that generates a README file for a directory and its contents using a text generation API. The script can be run from anywhere and uses a file picker GUI to select the directory to process. It can also be run from the command line with arguments to filter directories and files from being processed. The script generates a README file in Markdown format in the selected directory.

# requirements.txt
## Description
This file contains the dependencies required to run the Simple README Generator project. The listed packages are:

- requests: A Python library for making HTTP requests.
- tkinter: A Python library for creating graphical user interfaces.

These dependencies are necessary for the project's functionality and can be installed using pip.
