This script generates a README for a directory, as well as all its subdirectories. It can be run from anywhere, with the directory to be processed selected via a file picker GUI via tkinter. Command line arguments can be used to filter directories and files from being processed. The script is set up for Oobabooga WebUI at localhost, but is OpenAI Completions API compatible and easy to change to any similar API.
